```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

(a)
```{r,echo=FALSE}
B = matrix( c(3, 4, 7, 2), nrow=2, ncol=2)
colnames(B) <- c("Diabetic Complications Present","Diabetic Complications Absent")
rownames(B) <- c("Diabetic Control Good","Diabetic Control Poor")
print(B)
prop.table(B,1)
```
From above table, indeed it is different.

(b)
```{r,echo=FALSE}
t.test(prop.table(B,1)[,1],prop.table(B,1)[,2])

fisher.test(B)
```
Given the fisher test, p-value is 0.3024 > 0.05. Hence, the difference between the two rates is not statistically different.

(c) Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) is a statistical test applied to sets of categorical data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance.

Since there are no categorical data in this matrix, chi-squired test is not applicable.
